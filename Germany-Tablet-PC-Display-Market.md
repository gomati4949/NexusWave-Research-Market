Moreover, advancements in LCD technology, such as IPS (In-Plane Switching) and LED backlighting, have further enhanced their performance, improving viewing angles and overall image quality. These displays are widely adopted in mid-range tablet devices, balancing affordability and performance for the average user.</p><p>On the other hand, OLED displays are gaining traction due to their superior color accuracy, deep blacks, and thinner profiles compared to traditional LCD screens. Although OLED displays are more expensive, they provide an enhanced visual experience, especially in premium tablets and flagship devices. The growing demand for high-end tablets with superior display quality is driving the shift towards OLED technology.
