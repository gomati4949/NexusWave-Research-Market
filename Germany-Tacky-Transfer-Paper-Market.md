The heat transfer process ensures durability, vibrant color reproduction, and high-quality finishes. This type of paper is available in various formulations, such as for light or dark fabrics, further broadening its market appeal. <p>On the other hand, adhesive transfer paper is used for applying designs to surfaces that do not require heat.

This type of paper is highly favored for craft and DIY applications due to its ease of use and versatility.
